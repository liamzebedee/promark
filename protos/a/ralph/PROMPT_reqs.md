Interview me to understand the Job to Be Done.

Ask about:
- Who is the user? What's their context?
- What outcome do they want to achieve?
- What's painful about how they do it today?
- What does success look like?

Keep asking until the JTBD is crystal clear.
Use AskUserQuestion tool for structured interview.

Break this JTBD into distinct topics of concern.

SCOPE TEST: "One Sentence Without 'And'"
✓ "The color extraction system analyzes images to identify dominant colors"
✗ "The user system handles authentication, profiles, and billing" → 3 topics

If you need "and" to describe what it does, split it.

List each topic that needs its own spec.

For each topic of concern, create a spec file:
  specs/[topic-slug].md

Include:
- Purpose: What problem does this solve?
- Acceptance Criteria: Observable, verifiable outcomes
- Edge Cases: What could go wrong?
- Dependencies: What else does this need?

Capture the WHY throughout. Tests verify WHAT works.
Acceptance criteria should be behavioral (outcomes), not implementation (how).
